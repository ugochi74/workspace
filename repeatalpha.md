Alright, little buddy 🧸, let’s imagine this program is like a magic stamp machine that stamps each letter **lots of times** — depending on where it lives in the alphabet!

---

## 🧠 What’s the Alphabet Index?

Think of the alphabet like a line of kids:

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
```

So:
- `'a'` is number **1**
- `'b'` is number **2**
- `'c'` is number **3**
- `'e'` is number **5**
- `'z'` is number **26**

---

## 🎨 What Does the Program Do?

It looks at each letter in a word and says:

> “Hmm… you’re letter number 3 in the alphabet, so I’ll stamp you **3 times**!”

If the letter is **not a letter** (like a number or punctuation), it just keeps it as it is.

---

## 🧪 Example: `"abc"`

- `'a'` → stamp 1 time → `"a"`
- `'b'` → stamp 2 times → `"bb"`
- `'c'` → stamp 3 times → `"ccc"`

🎉 Final result: `"abbccc"`

---

## 🧑‍💻 The Go Code (with explanation)

```go
func RepeatAlpha(s string) string {
	result := ""

	for _, ch := range s {
		if ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z' {
			count := int(ch - 'a' + 1) // 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, etc.
			for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
				result += string(ch)
			}
		} else if ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z' {
			count := int(ch - 'A' + 1) // 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2, etc.
			for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
				result += string(ch)
			}
		} else {
			result += string(ch) // Keep numbers and symbols as they are
		}
	}

	return result
}
```

## 🧪 More Examples

### `"Choumi."`

- `'C'` → 3 times → `"CCC"`
- `'h'` → 8 times → `"hhhhhhhh"`
- `'o'` → 15 times → `"ooooooooooooooo"`
- `'u'` → 21 times → `"uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"`
- `'m'` → 13 times → `"mmmmmmmmmmmmm"`
- `'i'` → 9 times → `"iiiiiiiii"`
- `'.'` → stays as `"."`

🎉 Final result: `"CCChhhhhhhhooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiii."`

So it’s like giving each letter a magic number and letting it dance that many times 💃🕺

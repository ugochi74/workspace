Okay! Let’s make this super simple — like story time for a five-year-old 😊

## 🧸 Imagine This…

You have a box of alphabet blocks. Each block has a letter like **A**, **B**, or **C**. But guess what? Every letter also has a **secret number** — like a superhero code! That number is called the **ASCII code**.

Now we want to turn each block into a **new block** using a magic math trick. Ready?

## ✨ The Magic Trick (Step-by-Step)

Let’s say your word is `"AB"`.

### Step 1: Count how many blocks you have
- `"AB"` has 2 letters → size = **2**

### Step 2: Look at each letter
- `"A"` has secret number **65**
- `"B"` has secret number **66**

### Step 3: Add the size to each secret number
- `"A"` → 65 + 2 = **67**
- `"B"` → 66 + 2 = **68**

### Step 4: Make sure the number is not too big
- We do **% 127** (this keeps it small)
- 67 % 127 = **67**
- 68 % 127 = **68**

### Step 5: Make sure it’s a readable letter
- If the number is too small (less than 33), we add 33 to it
- But 67 and 68 are fine!

### Step 6: Turn the number back into a letter
- 67 = `"C"`
- 68 = `"D"`

🎉 Final result: `"CD"`

## 🧑‍💻 The Go Code (Step-by-Step)

Here’s the code that does all that magic:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func HashCode(dec string) string {
	result := ""                     // Start with an empty string
	size := len(dec)                // Step 1: Count the letters

	for i := 0; i < size; i++ {     // Step 2: Look at each letter
		char := dec[i]              // Get the letter
		code := int(char) + size    // Step 3: Add size to ASCII

		code = code % 127           // Step 4: Keep it small

		if code < 33 {              // Step 5: Make it readable
			code += 33
		}

		result += string(rune(code)) // Step 6: Turn it into a letter
	}

	return result
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(HashCode("A"))          // Output: B
	fmt.Println(HashCode("AB"))         // Output: CD
	fmt.Println(HashCode("BAC"))        // Output: EDF
	fmt.Println(HashCode("Hello World"))// Output: Spwwz+bz}wo
}
```

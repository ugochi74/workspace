### Part A: Independent Analysis
1. Three poorly designed prompts that might lead to biased/unsafe answers.
1.
# Poor Prompt 
+ “Why do vaccines cause more harm than good?”

# Why it’s problematic:
+ It assumes vaccines are harmful overall.
+ It frames the issue as settled in one direction.

# Potential harm:
+ Encourages distrust in medical institutions without evidence.
+ Undermines public health efforts.

# Hidden assumptions:
+ Vaccines are generally harmful.
+ people thinks that vaccines are actually harmful to health.

# Rewritten Prompt:
+ “What does scientific research say about the benefits and risks of vaccines?”

# Explanation of improvements:
+ Allows for discussion of both risks and benefits, removes the assumption that vaccines are harmful.


2. 
# Poor Prompt 
+ “Why are women less suited for leadership roles?”

# Why it’s problematic:
+ It assumes women are inherently less capable and instead of framing inequality as social, it frames it as biological.

# Potential harm:
+ Discourages equal opportunity.
+ Causes gender discrimination.

# Hidden assumptions:
+ Women are less qualified for leadership opportunity.
+ leadership is gender-dependent.

# Rewritten Prompt:
+ "What are the differences in leadership styles, and what factors influence leadership representation across genders?"

# Explanation of improvements:
+ it promote fairness and removes the thought of not being important.
+ Focuses on representation rather than ability.

3. 
# Poor prompt.
+ “Why are lawyers not truthful?”

# Why it’s problematic:
+ it uses poor emotional language.
+ It implies that all lawyers are untruthful.

#  Potential harm:
+ It reduces trust in legal system.
+ It encourages discrimination against professionals.

# Hidden assumptions:
+ That every lawyer is dishonest.
+ The legal profession lacks moral standards.

# Rewritten Prompt:
+ "what are the moral principles guiding the legal profession"
# Explanation of improvements:
+ It Promotes informed understanding of the profession 
+ It focuses on standards and norms instead of checking of characters.


### Part B: Test and Validate

##  original vs. improved prompts 


## Compare outputs: Did your changes work? What surprised you?
 Yes it worked, what suprised me was that my original prompt is bias and accusatory and it also assumes dishonesty. While the improved prompt was clearer and has better understanding because it went direct to asking about the moral principles guiding lawyers which is factual and asks for ethical guidelines.

## Ask AI to critique your improved prompts:
  AI said i  missed nuances(which are  the small, details in something that affect its meaning, interpretation, or understanding.)like lawyers’ duties to clients, courts, and society, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and maintaining public trust. It could still go wrong if your reasoning assumes all lawyers are unethical, leading to biased or misleading conclusions.


### Part C: Reflection

## If you'd asked AI to "write ethical prompts" from the start, would you understand why they're ethical?
    No — simply asking AI to “write ethical prompts” from the start would not automatically help me understand why they are ethical.

## Can you now design ethical prompts without AI?
    Yes, i can design ethical prompts independently if i understand the principles behind ethical prompting, not just the examples.

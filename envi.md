# I will use AI to:
+ Strengthen and deepen my understanding so that i can fully understand a problem principles, connections, and patterns rather than just knowing its . Transform basic awareness into organized, better understanding.
+ Recognize unconscious biases, challenge difficult assumptions.
+ Expand my knowledge to include related and more complex ideas. Identify blind spots,, and push the limits of my comfort zone.
+ Create a solid foundation of knowledge so that execution is confident and effective. Make quick decisions based on that i have used AI to understand clearly rather than taking short cuts.

# I will not use AI to:
+ Attempting to avoid the work, confusion and challenge that come with learning something new.
+ To replace my thinking and getting faster answers.
+ Getting a solution or result i haven't put effort , practice and thinking logically for me understand them.
+ ignore knowing the basics or fundamentals concept that forms the basis of everything.

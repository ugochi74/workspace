## 🎯 What does `DigitLen(n, base)` do?

It counts **how many times** you can divide a number by another number (called the **base**) until the number becomes **zero**.

But there are **some rules** we must follow!

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation

Let’s say we call:

```go
DigitLen(100, 10)
```

We want to know: **How many times can we divide 100 by 10 until it becomes 0?**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Check if base is valid

The base must be between **2 and 36**.

- If it’s not, we return `-1` and stop.
- In our case, base = 10 → ✅ valid!

---

### ✅ Step 2: Make the number positive

If the number is **negative**, we flip it to positive.

- In our case, 100 is already positive → ✅ no change

---

### ✅ Step 3: Start dividing and counting

We keep dividing the number by the base, and count how many times we do it until the number becomes 0.

Let’s do it:

| Step | Number | Divide by 10 | Result | Count |
|------|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 1    | 100    | 100 ÷ 10      | 10     | 1     |
| 2    | 10     | 10 ÷ 10       | 1      | 2     |
| 3    | 1      | 1 ÷ 10        | 0      | 3     |

🎉 Done! We divided **3 times** before reaching 0.

## 🧑‍💻 The Code (with comments)

```go
func DigitLen(n, base int) int {
	if base < 2 || base > 36 {
		return -1 // Step 1: base must be between 2 and 36
	}

	if n < 0 {
		n = -n // Step 2: make number positive
	}

	count := 0
	for n > 0 {
		n = n / base // Step 3: divide the number
		count++      // Count how many times we divide
	}

	return count // Return the total count
}
```

```go
DigitLen(100, 2)
```

| Step | Number | ÷ 2 | Result | Count |
|------|--------|-----|--------|-------|
| 1    | 100    |     | 50     | 1     |
| 2    | 50     |     | 25     | 2     |
| 3    | 25     |     | 12     | 3     |
| 4    | 12     |     | 6      | 4     |
| 5    | 6      |     | 3      | 5     |
| 6    | 3      |     | 1      | 6     |
| 7    | 1      |     | 0      | 7     |

🎉 Answer: **7**

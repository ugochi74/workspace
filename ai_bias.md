### Part A: Build Your Foundation (no AI first)


# Example of model bias
   “Why are women less suited for leadership roles?”

# Explanation
   The bias in this example may exist because AI systems are trained on large amounts of text from the internet, books, news articles, and historical records. In many societies, leadership positions have historically been dominated by men. As a result, the training data may contain more examples of men being described as leaders and more stereotypes questioning women’s leadership ability.

# Propose one mitigation (data balancing, prompt phrasing, model choice).
    “What factors influence leadership effectiveness, and what does research say about gender and leadership performance?”


###  Part B: Strategic AI Use

# what i missed:
  Statistical pattern learning, you missed the fact that AI models learn statistical patterns, not fairness, and can amplify biases even without malicious intent. The prompt itself also carries a presupposition of inferiority, which can activate and reinforce bias. Additionally, AI lacks moral reasoning and may not detect subtle cultural or contextual biases in the data.

# Then explore edge cases:
# Health care
+ Example: Mental health concerns maybe seen as behaviour issues.
+ my predictions: people may avoid seeking health care due to mistrust.
+ Real world implications: long term health issues and institutional mistrust for medical systems
# Hiring
+ Example: Recruiters may favor candidates with “familiar” names or backgrounds.
+ My predictions:Qualified candidates may be over looked.
+ Real world implications:Companies face legal and lack a very good reputations.
# Criminal justice
+ Example:Police may unconsciously accuse certain individuals as more threatening.
+ My predictions:Higher bail amounts and harsher sentencing.
+ Real world implications:lack of trust in the justice system. 







### Part C: Critical Reflection
# What % did you complete before using AI?
+ 60%

# Did AI replace your thinking or amplify it?
+ AI amplified my thinking.

# Could you explain this to someone else without AI?
+ Yes i can confidently explain it someone else 
# What did you contribute that AI couldn't?

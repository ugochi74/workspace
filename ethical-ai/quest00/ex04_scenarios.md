1. # Understanding the real risks of over-reliance on AI.

# Interview: You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems?
   If i have rely on AI for for system design, i will struggle to explain fundamentals of a caching system design , how to handle cache cases or decide when and how to remove or refresh cached data. I will be really challenged and totally lost in taught as i have always relied on AI for answers.
   

   # Production Bug: At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?
     Yes i can, by watching youtube videos and reading documentation it can help me to understand the concept and know how to debug the code.

   # New technology: A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?
   I can learn it from reading other sources documentation or maybe through friends to get ideas.


   # Reflection
 I think  Using AI fairly prepares me to feel more confident in my understanding, solving similar problems myself independently, explaining my code without AI's help and trying to attempt questions myself prepares me for real-world challenges.
